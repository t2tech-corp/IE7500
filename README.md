## Introduction

Iconic movie quotes have the power to evoke emotions, spark conversations, and create lasting impressions on audiences. 
These quotes often encapsulate a filmâ€™s emotional core, character depth, or overarching themes. Despite their cultural significance,
their broader emotional and thematic contexts are rarely analyzed or used as a gateway to discover related films. This gap leaves
untapped potential for audiences who wish to explore the connections between their favorite quotes and the cinematic universe they belong to.

## Project Description

With our Cinematic Quote Analyzer, we aim to develop an interactive tool that empowers users to explore the deeper meaning behind their favorite movie quotes.
Users will be able to input any cinematic quote, which the tool will analyze for its emotional tone, genre association, and contextual relevance within the script.
Leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and contextual embeddings, the tool will provide meaningful 
insights into the quote's significance. We also plan for the tool to offer tailored movie recommendations based on themes, tones, or dialogue styles, fostering a 
deeper appreciation for cinematic storytelling and connecting users with similar films they might enjoy!

## Dataset

[Describe the dataset used for this project.  Include:
* Name of the dataset (e.g., IMDB Movie Review Dataset, Twitter Sentiment Dataset).
* Source of the dataset (e.g., link to the download page).
* Size of the dataset (number of examples).
* Key features of the dataset (e.g., text, labels, etc.).
* Any preprocessing steps performed on the dataset.]

## Methodology

[Explain the NLP techniques and models used in your project.  For example:
* Preprocessing steps (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc.).
* Feature extraction methods (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.).
* Models used (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, RNNs, Transformers, etc.).
* Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.).]

## Implementation

[Provide details about the implementation:
* Programming languages used (e.g., Python).
* Libraries used (e.g., NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
* Structure of the code (briefly describe the different modules/files).  If the structure isn't obvious from the file names, explain the purpose of important files.
* How to run the code (see the Usage section below).]

## Requirements

[List the software and libraries required to run the project.  It's best to include a `requirements.txt` file for easy installation:]

## Usage
[Provide clear instructions on how to run the code.  Include specific commands and examples.Include any necessary configuration steps or data preparation steps.]

## Results
[Summarize the results of your project.  Include:

Performance metrics on the evaluation dataset.
Comparisons to other approaches (if applicable).
Any visualizations or graphs to illustrate the results.]

## Future Work
[Discuss potential improvements or extensions to the project.  For example:

Exploring different models or techniques.
Expanding the dataset.
Improving the performance.
Adding new features.]

## Contributing
